# Bundle scan stub → amd64.Builder migration — progress tracker

> **Purpose:** persistent record of where the migration stands so a
> different session, machine, or post-crash recovery can pick up
> without re-deriving context.
>
> **Update protocol:** every commit that advances a row → tick the
> box, paste the commit short-SHA, bump `last_updated` in front-matter.

## Companion docs

- `.dev/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-bundle-stub-builder-migration-audit.md`
  — instruction-by-instruction Builder/RawBytes mapping
- `.dev/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-bundle-stub-negate-and-winbuild.md`
  — final §5+§4-PHASE-B-2 byte layout (lands AFTER the migration)

## Phase 1 — Builder API gaps (~1h, 5 primitives)

Builder methods needed by the audit but missing from the API today.

- [x] **INC / CMP / TEST / JGE / JL** — added 2026-05-10 (commit 82132da)
- [x] **MOVL / AND** — added 2026-05-10 (commit 0d87fdb)
- [x] **CMPL** (32-bit CMP) — added 2026-05-10 (commit 4f2f159)
- [x] **SHL imm** — added 2026-05-10 (commit 4f2f159)
- [x] **JMPReg** (indirect jump through register) — added 2026-05-10 (commit 4f2f159)
- [x] **MOVBReg** (8-bit MOV reg-as-dst) — added 2026-05-10 (commit 4f2f159)
- [x] **SYSCALL** — added 2026-05-10 (commit 4f2f159)

**Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE** as of commit 4f2f159. Builder API now covers
every instruction in the migration audit except CPUID, gs-segment
override, and TEST r/m,imm (all RawBytes).

Tests required: byte-shape pin via x86asm decode, mirroring the
existing TestBuilder_AllMnemonics pattern.

## Phase 2 — V2 scan stub implementation (~1.5h)

`pe/packer/bundle_stub.go` — new function alongside the existing
hand-encoded `bundleStubVendorAware()`:

```go
func bundleStubVendorAwareV2() ([]byte, error) {
    // emits the same scan stub via amd64.Builder per the audit table
}
```

- [x] Section 1 (PIC trampoline) — RawBytes verbatim, V1 PIC byte-identical (commit pending)
- [x] Section 2 (CPUID prologue) — Builder + cpuid RawBytes
- [x] Section 3 (Loop setup) — Builder
- [x] Section 4 (Loop body) — Builder + 2 test-imm RawBytes
- [x] Section 5 (.no_match Linux) — Builder + SYSCALL
- [x] Section 6 (.matched + decrypt + JMP) — Builder + 17 B 8-bit-ops RawBytes block

**Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE** — `bundleStubVendorAwareV2()` shipped in
`pe/packer/bundle_stub_v2.go`. Outputs 204 bytes (V1 = 197, +7 byte
delta from XORQ-uses-REX vs V1's 32-bit XOR).
Bug found + fixed during V2 implementation: Builder.CMP/CMPL had
operand-order bug (Plan 9 binaryOp emits `src - dst` instead of the
documented `dst - src`). Fixed in same commit; pinned by
TestBuilder_CMP_PlanFlagDirection.

Bundle offset constants for post-encode patches:
- `bundleOffsetImm32Pos` — already exists; the V2 emission must
  produce its `add r15, imm32` at an offset reachable from the
  patch site (likely needs a labeled Marker concept in Builder).

## Phase 3 — Functional equivalence validation (~30 min)

- [x] `TestBundleStubV2_E2E_RunsExit42` — wires V2 into the wrap
  pipeline directly, runs the produced ELF on Linux, asserts exit
  code 42. **PASS** in commit pending. V2 stub dispatch through
  PIC + CPUID + scan loop + matched + decrypt + JMP + exit_group is
  functionally equivalent to V1.
- [ ] Existing `TestWrapBundleAsExecutableLinux_*` runtime tests
  green when V1 internally calls V2 (DEFERRED — V1 stays as
  primary path until §5+§4-B-2 land on V2; the E2E above already
  proves V2 works through the same wrap shape).
- [ ] Win VM E2E `TestWrapBundleAsExecutableWindows_E2E_RunsExit42Windows`
  with V2 (DEFERRED — Windows variant patches V1 bytes today; will
  swap to V2 once §5/§4-B-2 land which require the V2 foundation).

**Phase 3 ✅ green for the foundation.** The V2 → bundle pipeline
is runtime-validated. The remaining "V1 internally calls V2"
swap is a deferred housekeeping step; both V1 and V2 coexist
until the §5/§4-B-2 work makes V2 the canonical path.

## Phase 4 — Layer §5 + §4-PHASE-B-2 onto V2 (~2h, the unlock)

**Phase 4a — §5 negate flag — ✅ COMPLETE (commit pending)**
- [x] `bundleStubVendorAwareV2Negate()` shipped in
  `pe/packer/bundle_stub_v2_negate.go` — restructures per-entry
  test to R12B-accumulator pattern + XOR-with-negate + branch
- [x] TestBundleStubV2Negate_E2E_NegateFlipsMatch — PASS
- [x] TestBundleStubV2Negate_E2E_PTMatchAllStillWorks — PASS

Bug story (caught + fixed via gdb core dump):
  First iteration used AL as the accumulator (`mov al, 1`). AL is
  the low byte of EAX which is the loop counter. mov al, 1 made
  EAX = 1 instead of 0, so .matched dispatched to PayloadEntry[1]
  (which doesn't exist on 1-entry bundles → garbage pointer →
  SIGSEGV at `mov (%rdi),%al` in the decrypt loop). Switched to
  R12B as the accumulator (3-byte mov instead of 2-byte, but
  preserves EAX). Both tests now PASS.

**Phase 4b — §4-PHASE-B-2 PT_WIN_BUILD — ✅ COMPLETE (commit pending)**
- [x] `bundleStubV2NegateWinBuildWindows()` shipped in
  `pe/packer/bundle_stub_v2_winbuild.go` — Windows variant of the
  V2-Negate stub with EmitPEBBuildRead in prologue (saves
  OSBuildNumber to R13) and PT_WIN_BUILD bit-test + range compare
  inside the per-entry test
- [x] §2 ExitProcess block embedded inline at .exit_block label
  (replaces Linux's sys_exit_group)
- [x] `add rsp, 16` patch before `jmp rdi` (Windows-specific stack
  discipline so matched payload's `ret` reaches RtlUserThreadStart)
- [x] TestBundleStubV2NWBuilds — PASS (assembly clean, length 418 B)
- [x] TestBundleStubV2NW_PICTrampolinePrefix — PASS
- [x] TestBundleStubV2NW_E2E_PTMatchAllWindows — PASS on Win10 VM
- [x] TestBundleStubV2NW_E2E_PTWinBuildWindows — PASS on Win10 VM
  (PT_WIN_BUILD with [0..999999] matches host's actual build → exit 42)

**🎉 Phase 4 complete. Both §5 negate flag (Linux) and §4-PHASE-B-2
PT_WIN_BUILD (Windows) layered onto the Builder-driven scan stub
with auto-resolved Jcc displacements. Total Phases 1-4 done.**


Once V2 ships, Builder labels handle Jcc displacements
automatically. The negate-flag + PT_WIN_BUILD additions become
**structural changes** instead of byte-recompute exercises.

- [ ] Add `EmitPEBBuildRead` to V2 prologue + save EAX→R12 (3 bytes)
- [ ] Restructure per-entry test: `mov al, 1` → AND-of-checks → XOR-with-negate
- [ ] PT_WIN_BUILD bit check: `test r9b, 2` + EmitBuildRangeCheck
- [ ] Negate XOR: `movzx r9d, byte [r8+1]; and r9b, 1; xor al, r9b`
- [ ] Branch on AL: `jnz .matched` else `jmp .next`

Per the negate+winbuild spec, this adds ~80 bytes of new asm.
With Builder labels, no displacement recomputation needed.

- [ ] Win VM E2E green (same E2E as today, plus negate-specific
  2-entry test, plus PT_WIN_BUILD-specific test).

## Cross-session resumption checklist

When resuming on a different machine / new session:

1. Pull latest master.
2. Read this file's checkbox state to find the next unchecked row.
3. Read the companion specs:
    - audit doc (instruction map)
    - negate-and-winbuild doc (final byte layout for Phase 4)
4. Verify the dev environment:
    - `go test -count=1 -short ./pe/packer/...` green
    - `go test -count=1 -short ./pe/packer/stubgen/amd64/` green
    - libvirt VM `win10` reachable for the runtime gate
      (`virsh -c qemu:///system list` should show win10)
5. Pick up at the first unchecked Phase 1 row.

## Last-known-good signposts

| Aspect | State as of 2026-05-10 |
|---|---|
| Latest tag | v0.87.0 (§4 PHASE B-1 ImageBase) |
| HEAD commit | 4f2f159 (Phase 1 of migration complete) |
| Linux scan-stub bytes | hand-encoded in `bundle_stub.go::bundleStubVendorAware()` — UNCHANGED, runtime-green |
| Windows scan-stub | composes Linux bytes + §2 ExitProcess + 4-byte add-rsp patch — RUNTIME GREEN on win10 |
| Builder API | INC/CMP/TEST/JGE/JL/MOVL/AND/CMPL/SHL/JMPReg/MOVBReg/SYSCALL — all primitives needed for the migration ARE PRESENT |
| asmtrace VEH harness | shipped + working (debugged §2 + §4-A bugs already) |

## Open questions for the next session

1. Should V2 replace V1 in-place (single function) or coexist
   (V1 stays, V2 is the new path)? Audit doc recommends coexistence
   for incremental confidence; V1 retires once §5+§4-B-2 land.
2. The PIC trampoline's `call 0; pop r15; add r15, imm32` pattern
   stays RawBytes per the audit. The `imm32` patch site at byte
   offset 10 is critical — V2 must produce its bytes at the same
   offset for `bundleOffsetImm32Pos` to remain valid. Verify with a
   byte-offset assertion in Phase 2's first commit.
3. `injectStubJunk` (Intel multi-byte NOP polymorphism) inserts at
   slot A (offset 14, between PIC and CPUID prologue). After the
   migration this slot must remain at the same offset — Phase 2
   needs an integration test asserting `bundleStubVendorAwareV2`
   has the same slot-A offset as V1.
