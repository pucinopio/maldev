# Secure memory cleanup

[← cleanup index](README.md) · [docs/index](../../index.md)

## TL;DR

You decrypted your shellcode, used your encryption key,
fetched a C2 address. All three are still sitting in process
memory until the GC eventually overwrites them — minutes to
never. A memory dump in that window exposes everything.

| You want to wipe… | Use | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A `[]byte` slice (key, plaintext, decrypted blob) | [`SecureZero`](#securezero) | One pass; compiler-resistant (volatile) |
| A `VirtualAlloc`-backed region (shellcode RWX after exec) | [`WipeAndFree`](#wipeandfree) | Zero + `VirtualFree(MEM_RELEASE)` |
| Everything created inside a function scope | [`DoSecret`](#dosecret) | Defer-style: returned secrets get zeroed automatically when callback exits |

What this DOES achieve:

- Sensitive bytes are zeroed BEFORE control returns to the
  caller — no GC race, no compiler dead-store-elimination
  cleverness.
- For VirtualAlloc'd shellcode regions: zeroed THEN unmapped,
  so even a kernel-level scanner sees no commit.
- `DoSecret` makes the wipe defer-safe — caller can't forget.

What this does NOT achieve:

- **Doesn't wipe the Go heap copy** — `string` <-> `[]byte`
  conversions allocate. If the secret ever lived as a string,
  some pre-conversion copy may still be on the heap until
  GC. Avoid string conversions for secrets.
- **Doesn't wipe register / stack residue** — values that
  spilled to the stack during arithmetic stay until the
  stack frame is overwritten by something else. Acceptable
  for most threat models; not for nation-state forensic.
- **Crash-dump still wins if it happens BETWEEN secret
  creation and wipe** — keep the window short.
- **Linux: doesn't unmap if you didn't `VirtualAlloc`** —
  `WipeAndFree` is Windows-shaped. Use `SecureZero` then
  `mmap.Munmap` manually for the Linux equivalent.

## Primer

After your shellcode runs, its decrypted bytes, encryption keys, and C2
addresses sit in process memory. If the process is dumped — by an
analyst, EDR memory scanner, or LSASS-style live snapshot — that data is
exposed.

Naïve approaches fail:

- **`for i := range buf { buf[i] = 0 }`** — Go's optimizer happily
  removes the writes if it sees you don't read the buffer afterwards.
- **`copy(buf, make([]byte, len(buf)))`** — same problem.

Go's `clear` builtin is treated as an intrinsic the compiler must NOT
optimize away. `SecureZero` wraps it. `WipeAndFree` adds the
`VirtualProtect → write zeros → VirtualFree` sequence required when the
memory came from `windows.VirtualAlloc`. `DoSecret` is the experimental
Go 1.26 `runtimesecret` mode: register/stack/heap erasure on function
return.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph SecureZero
        BUF["[]byte"] --> CLEAR["clear(buf)<br>(intrinsic, not elidable)"]
        CLEAR --> ZEROED["all bytes 0x00"]
    end
    subgraph WipeAndFree
        VA["VirtualAlloc'd region"] --> PROT["VirtualProtect → RW"]
        PROT --> WRITE["zero loop"]
        WRITE --> FREE["VirtualFree(MEM_RELEASE)"]
    end
    subgraph DoSecret
        FN["func() { … }"] --> RUN["call inside runtime.Secret guard"]
        RUN --> ERASE["registers + stack + heap temps zeroed"]
        ERASE --> RET["return to caller"]
    end
```

`SecureZero` is the everyday tool. `WipeAndFree` is for the post-shellcode
RWX page. `DoSecret` is the new hotness — wrap any sensitive computation
unconditionally; without `runtimesecret` it's a no-op call.

## API → godoc

[`pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/cleanup/memory`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/cleanup/memory) is the authoritative
reference for every exported symbol. This page teaches the
*concepts*; the godoc is the *specification*.

## Examples

### Simple

```go
key := crypto.RandomKey(32)
defer memory.SecureZero(key)
// use key …
```

### Composed (with `crypto`)

```go
plaintext := decrypt(payload, key)
defer memory.SecureZero(plaintext)
defer memory.SecureZero(key)
// run shellcode …
```

### Advanced (post-injection cleanup)

```go
addr, _ := windows.VirtualAlloc(0, size,
    windows.MEM_COMMIT|windows.MEM_RESERVE,
    windows.PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE)
copy(unsafe.Slice((*byte)(unsafe.Pointer(addr)), size), shellcode)
runShellcode(addr)
_ = memory.WipeAndFree(addr, uint32(size))
```

### Complex (DoSecret for key derivation)

```go
var derived []byte
memory.DoSecret(func() {
    tmp := pbkdf2(password, salt, 100_000, 32)
    derived = make([]byte, len(tmp))
    copy(derived, tmp)
    memory.SecureZero(tmp) // belt + braces while DoSecret-experiment is non-default
})
// derived is the only surviving copy; password / pbkdf2 internals erased on Go 1.26+
```

## OPSEC & Detection

| Artefact | Where defenders look |
|---|---|
| `VirtualProtect(RWX → RW)` then `VirtualFree(MEM_RELEASE)` | EDR call-stack inspection — pattern is benign on its own |
| Process memory scanner finding zeroed pages where shellcode used to be | Periodic memory scanning (hard for blue at scale) |
| Crash dump captured BEFORE `WipeAndFree` runs | Out of scope for this primitive — guard with `defer` early |

**D3FEND counter:** [D3-PMA](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ProcessMemoryAnalysis/)
(Process Memory Analysis) — defeated by timely cleanup; remains
effective when defender captures dump before cleanup runs.

## MITRE ATT&CK

| T-ID | Name | Sub-coverage |
|---|---|---|
| [T1070](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/) | Indicator Removal | in-memory variant |

## Limitations

- **Cannot cover what's already on disk.** If a paged-out region was
  swapped to `pagefile.sys`, `SecureZero` doesn't reach the swap copy.
  Mitigation: `windows.VirtualLock` the region, then `VirtualUnlock` +
  zero before free.
- **`DoSecret` register erasure** requires `GOEXPERIMENT=runtimesecret`
  + Go 1.26+ + linux/amd64 or arm64. Without these, it's a plain call.
- **Compiler tail-call elision** can leak registers across `DoSecret`
  scope on certain architectures — confirm with `go tool objdump` for
  high-stakes uses.
- **Crash dumps** captured before the `defer` runs include the secrets
  in plain text.
