# Windows special-folder paths

[← recon index](README.md) · [docs/index](../../index.md)

## TL;DR

Resolve Windows special folder paths (Desktop, AppData,
Startup, Program Files, …) via `SHGetSpecialFolderPathW`. Used
by `persistence/startup` for StartUp-folder paths, by
`credentials/lsassdump` for `%SystemRoot%\System32\ntoskrnl.exe`,
and by any payload that needs a per-user / per-machine
well-known path.

## Primer

Windows uses **CSIDL** (Constant Special ID List) values to
identify well-known folders abstractly. `SHGetSpecialFolderPathW`
takes a CSIDL constant and returns the resolved filesystem path,
handling per-user / per-machine differences and folder
redirection in domain environments transparently.

The function is technically deprecated in favor of
`SHGetKnownFolderPath` (Vista+, KNOWNFOLDERID enum), but the
older API remains widely supported and avoids COM
initialization overhead.

## API → godoc

[`pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/folder`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/folder) is the authoritative
reference for every exported symbol. This page teaches the
*concepts*; the godoc is the *specification*.

## Examples

### Simple — modern KNOWNFOLDERID

```go
import (
    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/folder"
    "golang.org/x/sys/windows"
)

appdata, _   := folder.GetKnown(windows.FOLDERID_RoamingAppData, 0)
downloads, _ := folder.GetKnown(windows.FOLDERID_Downloads, 0)
system, _    := folder.GetKnown(windows.FOLDERID_System, 0)

// Force creation (KFF_CREATE) when staging a per-user drop directory:
stage, _ := folder.GetKnown(windows.FOLDERID_LocalAppData, windows.KF_FLAG_CREATE)
```

### Simple — legacy CSIDL

```go
appdata := folder.Get(folder.CSIDL_APPDATA, false)
startup := folder.Get(folder.CSIDL_STARTUP, false)
system  := folder.Get(folder.CSIDL_SYSTEM, false)
```

### Composed — feed persistence

```go
import (
    "path/filepath"

    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/folder"
)

implant := filepath.Join(
    folder.Get(folder.CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA, false),
    "Microsoft", "OneDrive", "Update", "winupdate.exe",
)
```

### Advanced — resolve ntoskrnl path for kernel-driver work

```go
ntos := filepath.Join(
    folder.Get(folder.CSIDL_SYSTEM, false),
    "ntoskrnl.exe",
)
// feeds credentials/lsassdump.DiscoverProtectionOffset(ntos, opener)
```

## OPSEC & Detection

| Artefact | Where defenders look |
|---|---|
| `SHGetSpecialFolderPathW` calls | Universal Win32 API — invisible |
| Subsequent file writes to resolved paths | EDR file-write telemetry; flag depends on the path |

**D3FEND counters:** none specific — primitive itself is
universally legitimate.

**Hardening:** none — the call is invisible. Hardening is at
the consumer (the writes the path drives).

## MITRE ATT&CK

| T-ID | Name | Sub-coverage | D3FEND counter |

## Limitations

- **CSIDL is the legacy path.** Microsoft recommends
  KNOWNFOLDERID for new code. The package now ships both:
  use [`GetKnown`](#getknownrfid-windowsguid-flags-knownfolderflag-string-error)
  for new callers; `Get` stays for backwards compatibility.
  KNOWNFOLDERID also exposes folders the legacy CSIDL set
  cannot resolve (`FOLDERID_Downloads`, third-party Shell
  extensions).
- **`GetKnown` returns API-allocated PWSTR.** The wrapper
  frees it via `CoTaskMemFree` on every call — never returns
  a borrowed buffer the caller must clean up.
- **MAX_PATH cap on `Get` only.** The legacy path truncates
  paths longer than 260 chars (`Get`); `GetKnown` is uncapped.
- **Some virtual folders return empty.** `CSIDL_NETWORK`,
  `CSIDL_PRINTERS`, and similar non-filesystem virtual folders
  return empty strings.
- **Folder redirection is opaque.** Domain-joined hosts with
  redirected user folders return the redirected (network) path,
  not the local cached one — operators relying on local-only
  paths must validate.
