# Time-based sandbox evasion

[← recon index](README.md) · [docs/index](../../index.md)

## TL;DR

Burn CPU for a real wall-clock duration to defeat sandboxes
that fast-forward `Sleep()`. Two flavours: tight time-comparison
loop ([`BusyWait`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing)) or primality-testing
loop ([`BusyWaitPrimality`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing)) for a
math-like CPU pattern.

## Primer

Sandboxes commonly hook `Sleep` / `WaitForSingleObject` to skip
waits and observe what the implant does next. A 30-second
`Sleep()` becomes a no-op; a 30-second BusyWait does not. The
distinction is subtle but reliable — sandboxes have analysis
budgets, and a 30-second CPU burn forces them to either
fast-forward (impossible — there's no kernel hook for "spin
faster") or use up their budget.

Two implementations, both cross-platform:

- [`BusyWait`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing) — repeatedly compares
  `time.Now()` to the deadline. Pinning one core at 100% in a
  tight comparison is cheap to fingerprint behaviourally.
- [`BusyWaitPrimality`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing) — burns CPU via
  primality testing. Same wall-clock effect, more "math
  workload"-like CPU pattern.

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Imp as "Implant"
    participant Hook as "Sandbox<br>(Sleep hook)"
    participant CPU

    Note over Imp: Naive Sleep — sandbox fast-forwards
    Imp->>Hook: Sleep(30 * time.Second)
    Hook-->>Imp: instant return

    Note over Imp: BusyWait — sandbox can't fast-forward CPU loops
    Imp->>CPU: for time.Now() < deadline { … }
    CPU-->>Imp: 30 s real wall-clock burned
    Note over Imp: Sandbox analysis budget exhausted
```

## API → godoc

[`pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing) is the authoritative
reference for every exported symbol. This page teaches the
*concepts*; the godoc is the *specification*.

## Examples

### Simple — 30-second burn at startup

```go
import (
    "time"

    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing"
)

timing.BusyWait(30 * time.Second)
// Sandbox analysis budget likely exhausted; continue.
```

### Composed — primality variant

```go
timing.BusyWaitPrimalityN(50_000_000)
// ~30 s on modern hardware; CPU pattern looks like prime sieving.
```

### Pipeline — sandbox bail + timing

```go
import (
    "context"
    "os"

    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/sandbox"
    "github.com/oioio-space/maldev/recon/timing"
)

if hit, _, _ := sandbox.New(sandbox.DefaultConfig()).IsSandboxed(context.Background()); hit {
    os.Exit(0)
}
timing.BusyWait(30 * time.Second) // catch sandboxes that bypassed dimension checks
```

## OPSEC & Detection

| Artefact | Where defenders look |
|---|---|
| 100% CPU on one core for sustained periods | Behavioural EDR rarely flags; some hypervisor-aware sandboxes do |
| Process at 100% CPU then transitions to network I/O | Pattern-matching EDR may correlate |
| `time.Now()` syscall storms | Per-call telemetry — invisible at user-mode |

**D3FEND counters:**

- [D3-EI](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ExecutionIsolation/)
  — sandbox design itself.

**Hardening for the operator:**

- Use `BusyWaitPrimality` over `BusyWait` for less-fingerprintable
  CPU pattern.
- Stagger BusyWait calls between meaningful operations rather
  than one giant block at startup — looks more like a long-running
  workload, less like a sandbox-detection sentinel.

## MITRE ATT&CK

| T-ID | Name | Sub-coverage | D3FEND counter |
|---|---|---|---|
| [T1497.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003/) | Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion | full — CPU-burn defeats Sleep hooks | D3-EI |

## Limitations

- **CPU spike.** 100% CPU on a target with idle expectations
  is itself a tell; calibrate duration against target's
  expected workload.
- **Doesn't help against real targets.** A 30-second startup
  delay is user-visible on real targets — only acceptable for
  background services / persistence binaries.
- **No defeat for live VM emulation.** Sandboxes running on
  bare-metal at full speed can still capture full behaviour;
  CPU-burn just prevents the trivial Sleep-hook bypass.
